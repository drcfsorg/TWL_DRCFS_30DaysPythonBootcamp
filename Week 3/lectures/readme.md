### What is web scraping?

 Web scraping is a way to automatically extract information from websites. Imagine you have a big book with lots of different stories, and you want to find all the stories about animals. To do this, you could go through the book page by page, looking for the word "animal" and writing down the page number of every story that has it. This would be very slow and tedious, but it would be a way to get the information you want.

In the same way, web scraping is a way to quickly and automatically find and collect information from websites. Here is some simple Python code that shows how web scraping works


In this code, we are using the requests library to send a request to the website at the URL http://sastodeal.com, and then using the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML of the page and find all the elements with the class "story". Finally, we are looping through all the stories and printing their text.

Web scraping can be a powerful tool for collecting data from the internet, but it is important to use it responsibly and with permission from the website owner.
